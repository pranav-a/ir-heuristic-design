[**Content-based Recommendation in Social Tagging Systems**, *Iv√°n Cantador*](https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/665157/content-based_cantador_recsys_2010_ps.pdf?sequence=3) | Adaptations of BM25 and Vector space models are used to recommend content to Delicious and Last.fm users. Cosine similarity between BM25 value of user profile and item profile works the best. This concludes that penalization of the common tags gives more accuracy. | IR models used for recommendation | They could have experimented with some changes in the length normalization part. | Adomavicius, G., Tuzhilin, A. 2005.
