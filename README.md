[**Content-based Recommendation in Social Tagging Systems**, *Iv√°n Cantador*](https://repositorio.uam.es/bitstream/handle/10486/665157/content-based_cantador_recsys_2010_ps.pdf?sequence=3), Cantador | Adaptations of BM25 and Vector space models are used to recommend content to Delicious and Last.fm users. Cosine similarity between BM25 value of user profile and item profile works the best. This concludes that penalization of the common tags gives more accuracy. | They could have experimented with some changes in the length normalization part. Only MAP and Precision in a tabular format is shown. Parameter sensitivity graphs could make this paper more cool. | [This really cool survey](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee378b/papers/adomavicius-recsys.pdf) |
[**Friend Recommendation Method using Physical and Social Context**, *Kwon* ](http://paper.ijcsns.org/07_book/201011/20101118.pdf), Kwon | BM25 is used to balance between the "logging in" variables vs. other friends. The score is then treated as a graphical proximity between users. | Worst paper I have ever read. How do such papers get accepted? | Nope |
[**Toward the Next Generation of Recommender Systems: A Survey of the State-of-the-Art and Possible Extensions**, *Gediminas*](http://web.stanford.edu/class/ee378b/papers/adomavicius-recsys.pdf) | | Very biased paper. Only TF-IDF model is included while taking about information retrieval. ||
